Game for tweetJam limited to 560 characters 

# Escape the red blocks

Use 'a' to move left and 's' to move right, escape the red enemies.
When you die the game automatically closes and your score is displayed in the terminal.
Technically you can leave the screen and be invincible, but thats not the fun part of the game, so dont do it >:(

This game is really simple, and I wanted to do in pygame as a chalenge and to compare
with other non restricted pygames, to see how much code size affect the result

# Required

python3, pygame


_script.py just checks the lenght of the main.py file to see if its less than 560_
