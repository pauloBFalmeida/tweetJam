Game for tweetJam limited to 560 characters 

# Gameplay

Use your mouse to escape the red enemies.
When you die the game automatically closes and your score is displayed in the terminal.

This game is really simple, and I wanted to do in pygame as a chalenge and to compare
with other non restricted pygames, to see how much code size affect the result

# Required

python3, pygame


_script.py just checks the lenght of the main.py file to see if its less than 560_
